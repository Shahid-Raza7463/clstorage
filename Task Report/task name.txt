Users cannot delete or edit exam leave and casual leave saved timesheets on the Timesheet Save Listing page.
When an assignment is created, an email will be sent to the partner. The date format in the email will be: dd-mm-yyyy (like 01-01-1999).
Rejected timesheet data is not showing for the user's ID.
Attendance records have been fixed for all exit users from 01-09-2024 to 25-11-2024. Please verify the attendance records for these users (September to November).

The 'Submit Timesheet for Week' button will be displayed if one week of data exists on the Timesheet Save Listing page.


The user cannot apply for leave on a Sunday.
The user cannot apply for leave on a holiday.
The user cannot apply for leave if the "From" date is a Sunday or the "To" date is a Sunday.
The user cannot apply for leave if the "From" date is a holiday or the "To" date is a holiday.
The user cannot apply for leave if the "From" date is a Saturday or the "To" date is a Saturday, this is only for staff.
When a user's timesheet is rejected continuously for more than 8 days, if the user has not submitted the Sunday date timesheet, they currently cannot apply for leave. However, if the Sunday timesheet is submitted, the user can apply for leave. The client now wants the functionality updated so that the user can apply for leave even if the Sunday timesheet is not submitted
In attendance module total no of days 0 for october months fixed on vsalive
Total hour count bugs fixed, bugs no is vs-224.

I spoke to the client regarding assignments being displayed on one page. However, when I checked, the functionality to show all assignments already exists, and I have informed the client about it
