1.if we select holiday as one of the clients and add more entries then attendance data could reflect incorrectly
2. Doj to be linked to attendance as user can becomes active and fill timesheet
3. Leaving date - attendance will show a cross after auto-submissions of timesheet
4. User will not be visible in attendance for next payroll cycle
5. User fills timesheet for mon-Fri but canâ€™t submit before Saturday. Thereafter user is in leave till payroll cycle gets initiated. TS will not be auto-submitted as user is active.
6. Holiday list to be in sync with attendance data



1.link teams with attendance data, if user is 'active' in teams then will be visible in attendance
2.Holiday list (dynamic) is updated and reflected in attendance
3.Attendance column enable after DOJ, check if there is a new joinee this month
4.Attendance data updated when user exits (leaves) - TS is auto-submitted and user should not be in Nov Cycle
5.dates after exit date will show cross (x) in attendance
6.CL credit rule if user joins after 15th day of the month (not directly linked but will show leave balance) 
7.Un-submitted TS data is 'active' user goes on extended leave without submission 
8.Till EL approval is 'in progress' user can not fill TS; this works
9.If leave rejected then TS will be available - this works too
10.Holiday + Travel is pending.

1.The client wants to know the active and inactive users in the attendance report.
2.If a user does not submit their timesheet continuously for one month, the attendance record should reflect this.
3.When selecting an employee name, start date, and end date, the client wants to check the leaving date. If the start date is after the leaving date, a warning message should appear: "You cannot select a date after the leaving date.
4.When selecting an employee name, start date, and end date, the client wants to check the joining date. If the start date is before the joining date, a warning message should appear: "You cannot select a date before the joining date.
5.The client wants a warning message when saving timesheet data that exists after the leaving date in the profile section, once the leaving date has been entered.

Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I am writing to formally raise my concerns regarding the working environment I experienced at the client site.

Working Conditions: The overall working environment was not conducive to productivity. The seating arrangement was overcrowded, with more team members than the space was designed to accommodate.

Lighting Issue: I was frequently stopped from turning on the lights.

Basic Requirement: When I requested a plate for my meal, it was not provided, and I had to arrange one myself.

Washing Facilities: After meals, when I needed to wash my hands, I was initially not allowed to use the kitchen area. However, after the driver intervened, I was permitted to use it.

Thank you for your time and understanding. Please let me know if further details are required.

Best regards,
Md Shahid Raza



The client wants to remove the 'type' input field from the team member addition form when the assignment is closed and display it only when the assignment is open. 


1.Assignment Details on mail when assignment closed by otp. 
2.The date format should be 01-01-2024 on the webpage and also 01-01-2024 in Excel. 
3.Implemented checkbox on assignment create page so that user submit form without select team member currently user cannot create assignment without team member selection. 
4.Assignment viewer list on assignment view page to view user only. 
5.Total hours will be shown on assignment view page to partner, manager and staff. 
6.Assignment total hour show on assignment report tab. 
7.Assignment total hour show on admin panel according teamwise. 
8.Assignment total hours show on the assignment time report tab. 
9.The partner list and their total hours on assignment view page.

This task needs to be retested because the description I provided earlier was you understood in another way So, please retest it



The task I uploaded on VSAlive is a separate task that is not currently in Jira. I needed to fix some data in the attendance report, and that specific task has been uploaded to VSAlive. It was not possible to provide it on VSADemo for testing.
