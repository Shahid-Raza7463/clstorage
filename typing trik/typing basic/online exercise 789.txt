Time is gold and time is money, if we utilÄ±ze it in a prop way and would not tolerate to waste even a single minute, because lost minutes add up to lost hours, lost hours add up to lost days, 1Ost days add up to lost years and lost years add up to fruitless life or a life in which so much remained undone. Many of us that are to say office clerks, administrators, doctors, teachers, engineers, law- yers, journalists and others are content to drift along, through the day, because they do not prepare a definite schedule of their activities. So, at the end of every day, they find that very little has been achieved. This is how day succeeds day resulting in a life of very little achievement. Likewise, many of us have no fixed time for rising and so often we sleep extra-long and have to race through the morning news- paper, bath, dress, bolt our breakfast and hurry along to the office. Why is this so? Because we have no clear-cut idea of all that we have to do during the day. We chat overlong with a friend who may call and sometimes there are many callers resulting in half com-plated work which is differed to the next day. On the other hand, if we discipline ourselves rigidly and prep area schedule in advance of all our activities for the whole day and ration time in proportion to the importance of different spheres of activity, we can do much more in brief span of 24 hours and thus enjoy a sense of satisfaction and achievement. It is good to draw up a schedule for the next day's activity at night. By doing so, we know when exactly we have to rise next morning and at what pace we have to complete the various items on our schedule. We should set aside a certain amount of time every day for the family, exercise and recreation and for reading and other means of self-improvement. Often there are instructive and interesting talks by experts at some institution, exhibitions, music recitals and other cultural activities which we must not ignore, because these improve our personality. Thus, the secret of success in our life lies in the most scientific and systematic use of time, as far as possible.

..It is one thing to get into a community college. It is another to get credits for courses. Many students are ill-prepared. They may not be ready for college-level work. They must take remedial courses. Most remedial courses are for reading or math. The problem is that remedial courses cost money and take time. Students often feel like they are "treading water." Some feel the remedial courses are not "real" college classes. The dropout rates are high. University of New York (CUNY) wanted to do something to reduce the dropout rate. The school looked at the results of the entry test. Some of the students had been out of school for several years. It focused on those students who almost passed. CUNY is letting those students who almost passed retake the test. About half pass on the second try. Was the test doing a good job of finding students who needed more help? CUNY decided that the answer was no. It put a new test in place. The steps for moving from remedial to credit classes is also changing. Before, students had to pass a test at the end of the remedial course. Now, they just must pass the course. They still take the test, but it is a factor for only 35 percent of the final grade. It may also start looking at how students did in certain high school classes. Algebra was a required part of the math entry exam. Now students can take an alternative course such as statistics. CUNY has taken one more step to make life better for students. While students are taking a remedial math course, they can take another course. This course will be a credit course. They call it a "co-requisite" course. The remedial course will help them pass the regular course. Community colleges in Tennessee have had good results with this approach. Everyone knows tests are important. But experts say tests should not be the only thing that matters. It makes good sense to move student ahead.

..The last thing you should do for back pain is use pain killers. Those are the opioids that can lead to addiction. And sometimes, they can lead to other drugs such as heroin. A new report takes a different approach. The report breaks down back pain into two groups. The first group includes pain that lasts less than twelve weeks. For this type of pain, the report says try applying heat or getting a massage. Exercise can help. You can try acupuncture. You can go to a chiropractor. You can try over-the-counter drugs such as Advil. The report says some common drugs like Tylenol are not effective. See what works best for you. You can get drugs such as Celebrex or Flexeril from your doctor. There are drugs that are more powerful. Cymbalta treats anxiety and depression. Tramadol is a less addicting opioid. Discuss any use with your doctor. The second pain group includes chronic pain that lasts more than twelve weeks. You should try the methods listed above first. If they do not work, there are other things to do. You can try physical therapy. You can try stress reduction. The report says you might want to try mindfulness or behavioral therapy. Talk to a professional about what might work best for you. Most adults have back pain at some time in their life. It is often the reason people miss work. It happens as people get older and their bodies change. It involves changes in the spine, muscles, discs and nerves. It involves the way people move. It can be the result of poor posture. Back pain can happen without warning. It can be the result of an accident or by lifting something heavy. It can be the result of too much or too little exercise. A doctor said. "About one-quarter of U.S. adults have had back pain in the past few months." The doctor said that it is a good idea to try not to use drugs. He said opioids, even for chronic back pain, are "prescribed more often than we like to see." Recent studies have found that doctors have their preferences. You may have to ask around for a health professional who favors more natural approaches. There is no one-size-fits-all answer.

..The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to free speech. It guarantees not just the right to make free speech, but the right to hear free speech. The internet is one path to free speech in America. In America, there are debates over the cost of internet services. In China, the government is shutting down internet debate, period. The way the Chinese do this is by closing down internet networks. Censors do not allow Chinese access to YouTube and Google among others. The Chinese practice of closing down the internet is not new. In recent weeks it has become worse. Some say the current climate is the result of the lead-up to a key Chinese Communist Party meeting. The 19th Party Congress takes place this fall. For a long time, smart Chinese internet users have gotten around the censors. Most of them use virtual private networks (VPNs). These are ways of getting around the bans on content. The authorities are targeting these tools. For example, they made Apple pull its VPN apps off the shelves in its stores. Amazon has a cloud computing service. It warned its customers to stop hosting the VPN tools on their sites. Some observers call this a 'cat and mouse game.' Last week the censors showed how much power they had. The censors tried a new way of shutting down websites. They went after the tools that many Chinese use. They cut off the country's internet users from the rest of the world. Internet users continue to try to outwit the country's vast online censorship system. For example, some users can still get to foreign VPNs. An expert said, "It does appear the crackdown is becoming more intense. But the internet is also more powerful than it has ever been." Some say China is trying to create a great firewall. Can a country that stifles free speech be a great nation?








..Dreamers came to the U.S. as children with their parents. The parents were here without legal documents. President Obama said the Dreamers could stay and go to school and work. President Trump has now said they cannot. There are about 800,000 Dreamers in the U.S. People who support and people who oppose Dreamers agree on one thing. The U.S. Congress is the right place to decide their fate. The Dreamers are here in the Latin phrase as de facto residents. In fact, they are here. They are not here as de jure residents. They are not legal residents protected by law. What happens next? How do you make Congress act? Some think a new civil rights movement will start. Dreamers have many supporters in every sector of the nation. They will have to work together and begin campaigns to make Congress work on their behalf. Opponents of the Dreamers will also make a big effort. They oppose Dreamers for two reasons. The first reason is that they think President Obama did not have the legal right to allow the Dreamers to stay in the country. The second reason is that they are against what they call "illegal immigration." They believe that, if Congress acts, it should deport the Dreamers. And all who came or stayed in the U.S. without papers. History should be on the side of the Dreamers. All over the world, people are on the move to improve their lives. Some are fleeing war. Others are fleeing poverty. In general, the burden is on the country taking them in to do the right thing. The migrants are leaving failed states. That includes Mexico. But the difference is that states are states and people are people. You cannot treat them in the same way. The Dreamers came to America as children. They were not a party to the decision to go to the U.S. That is a strong moral argument on their behalf. For opponents, it does not matter. Opponents believe Dreamers are taking jobs and seats in schools away from 'Americans.' At the same time, friends and many foes think the Dreamers are good people. Trump has expressed support for Dreamers. During the campaign, Trump said he would and now has, ended the Dreamers' program. In the days ahead, details of how the program will end will come out. In the months ahead, Americans will have their views tested in the political arenas of the nation











..Jhumpa Lahiri's "The Third and Final Continent," is a moving tale of an Indian immigrant. This young man's ambitious character led him to travel abroad. His struggle took him to attend many great learning institutions. His journeys led him to and elderly woman that made quite an impact on him. Her presence in his life was very significant. This story took place in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1969. The city had two major universities that attracted many foreigners. Boston provided an opportunity to those looking for and education and a better way of life. Many viewed Boston as an international city. It became a home for the young man from India. The narrator tells this story in the Third person unlimited omniscient. It seems as though she is telling the story through her own personal experiences. The reader can almost feel her struggle. The young man keeping with old Indian traditions had an arranged marriage. He seemed very casual and not the least bit interested in taking a wife or the commitment that came with marriage. This is an evident man vs. man relationship. For the average Indian-American there is a personal disconnect when it comes to the idea of home. For where is home? It cannot be America, for as Indians we don't always feel accepted; there will always be something about us that makes us different, that sets us apart from the peers we grew up with. And it won't be India for as Americans we have not lived authentically Indian lives. Always juggling apple pies and samosas, we straddle and mix two different cultures, effectively diluting both of them, never having a strong presence in either. The Americans look at you differently because you have brown skin, different customs. The Indians wonder about your outward appearance, an incongruous amalgam of brown skin and an American accent. So where do we belong? Are we always doomed to live in the uncertainty of hyphenated ethnicities? Our immigrant parents hope not and strive to give us a home to call our own, two homes even, whether America or India cares to accept us or not. Yes, as they drag us through the bustling streets of Thrissur or New Delhi from one auntie's house to the next, as they point out the cows and temples along the way, carefully trying to teach us the proper way to speak in their native language, our parents are making every effort to connect us to our heir.12
