Shahid Raza
 also please make sure the point raise by client during testing of Promotion is well communicated to the team and the same is not repeated in future

 simmi can we start testing it today, even if we can start it in second half?

 we will connect at 2 and take it forward

 point number 5,and 9 in vs-154 ,Who tested the filter functionality in the attendance tab ? 

 I have fixed this issue and have sent the code for upload to bahadur sir

 on attandence tab, filter functionality does not work properly when select end date in 2025

 but i have manually enter end date so client can choose end date in future  by mistake
 

 As per the client's discussion, this task is working correctly and does not need any changes.
As per the client's discussion, this task is working correctly and does not need to clear leaving date after submitting data .  

If a timesheet is rejected for more than one consecutive day, the user can apply for leave on those days, and the attendance table will be updated accordingly

I have deployed all previously QA-passed tasks on VSAlive, and some tasks are in QA, so we need to test them.
